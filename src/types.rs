/*!
 * Interface to the character encoding.
 *
 * # Raw incremental interface
 *
 * Methods which name starts with `raw_` constitute the raw incremental interface,
 * the lowest-available API for encoders and decoders.
 * This interface divides the entire input to four parts:
 *
 * - **Processed** bytes do not affect the future result.
 * - **Unprocessed** bytes may affect the future result
 *   and can be a part of problematic sequence according to the future input.
 * - **Problematic** byte is the first byte that causes an error condition.
 * - **Remaining** bytes are not yet processed nor read,
 *   so the caller should feed any remaining bytes again.
 *
 * The following figure illustrates an example of successive `raw_feed` calls:
 *
 * ````
 * 1st raw_feed   :2nd raw_feed   :3rd raw_feed
 * ----------+----:---------------:--+--+---------
 *           |    :               :  |  |
 * ----------+----:---------------:--+--+---------
 * processed  unprocessed             |  remaining
 *                               problematic
 * ````
 *
 * Since these parts can span the multiple input sequences to `raw_feed`,
 * `raw_feed` returns two offsets (one optional)
 * with that the caller can track the problematic sequence.
 * The first offset (the first `uint` in the tuple) points to the first unprocessed bytes,
 * or is zero when unprocessed bytes have started before the current call.
 * (The first unprocessed byte can also be at offset 0,
 * which doesn't make a difference for the caller.)
 * The second offset (`upto` field in the `CodecError` struct), if any,
 * points to the first remaining bytes.
 *
 * If the caller needs to recover the error via the problematic sequence,
 * then the caller starts to save the unprocessed bytes when the first offset < the input length,
 * appends any new unprocessed bytes while the first offset is zero,
 * and discards unprocessed bytes when first offset becomes non-zero
 * while saving new unprocessed bytes when the first offset < the input length.
 * Then the caller checks for the error condition
 * and can use the saved unprocessed bytes for error recovery.
 * Alternatively, if the caller only wants to replace the problematic sequence
 * with a fixed string (like U+FFFD),
 * then it can just discard the first sequence and can emit the fixed string on an error.
 * It still has to feed the input bytes starting at the second offset again.
